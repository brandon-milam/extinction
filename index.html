			<h2>History</h2>
			<div class="col-text-wrap">
				<p>The "wooly mammoth" is by far the most well known of the extinct ice age animals. When looking for these incredible specimens, archeologists will often only find teeth and tusks. However, there are multiple exhibits of nearly complete mammoths located in many museums. Most of these museums are found in Ohio, where the mastodons originate. They became extinct almost 10,000 years ago.</p>

				<p>Extinction- What Happened? <br></br>
				There are many hypothesize about the extinction of mastodons. How did such large creature that was holding his own through the ice age just suddenly die off? Was it a comet or an asteroid that hit to destroy theses creatures? Was it widespread wildfires? Was it the "over-kill" hypothesis? Majority believe that these specimens started dying because of two huge factors: being hunted and being starved. Many believe that when people started to arrive in the territory of the mastodon, they would kill them to use every part of the animal. Not one part was to go to waste. Also, many believe the humans came in and started taking all of the food that these animals ate, therefore starving the mastodons.  </p>

			<h2>Description</h2>
			<div class="col-text-wrap">
				<p>Mastodons most closely resemble elephants. Mammoths are enormous, burly creatures. They are built sturdily as they are amazingly strong. On average, adult mammoths were about nine feet tall, and could easily weigh about four or five tons. Archeologists tend to believe they were attacked by hunters because they have cone-shaped teeth. Lastly, mastodons are extremely hairy. These creatures abided in the ice age, therefore, they needed the immense amount of fur to keep themselves warm through the harsh cold. </p>

				<p>Classification and Species <br></br>
				Most fossils of mastodons that have been found throughout the years fall under the genus Mammut. There are multiple classifications of Mammut. M. americanum is the most well known species of Mammut. The remains found in Northern America would fall under this classification. The appearance of this specific specie most closely resembles that of a woolly mammoth. Another specie that is almost identical to M. americanum is M. matthewi. Most believe their are just a few or no differences between the two. </p>
